# Review Anaytics
I have written a [Google review scraper](https://github.com/saisyam/reviews-scraper) to extract reviews for restaurants. This project used the reviews scrapped from the review scraper to provide some insights into the data. This project consists of three components:

1. Frontend UI built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
2. Backend built using Python [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
3. MongoDB to store reviews information

This project use `docker` for all the above three components and use `docker-compose` to run them locally.
